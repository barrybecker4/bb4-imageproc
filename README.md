Scala image-breeder application and some other java2D image related demo code.

A significant portion of this code in this project comes from "Java 2D Graphics" by Jonathan Knudsen.
Virtually all of the files in the java2d/examples package come from ftp://ftp.oreilly.com/pub/examples/java/2d.
The code is originally the work of Jonathan Knudsen. I have only modified and added to it to suit the
needs of my other projects with depend on the java2d jar produced by this subproject.
   I give full credit to Jonathan Knudsen and believe I am making use of his work here in
accordance with the implicit licensing agreement (or lack thereof) of the soure code provided with his book.

The image-breeder application and some of the demos depend on the jhlabs library created by Jerry Huxtable. I have a fork of
it with some minor modification at https://github.com/barrybecker4/jhlabs.git
