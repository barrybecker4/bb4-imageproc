Scala java2D image related demo code.

A significant portion of this code in this project comes from "Java 2D Graphics" by Jonathan Knudsen.
Virtually all of the files in the java2d/examples package come from ftp://ftp.oreilly.com/pub/examples/java/2d.
The code is originally the work of Jonathan Knudsen. I have only modified and added to it to suit the
needs of my other projects with depend on the java2d jar produced by this subproject.
   I give full credit to Jonathan Knudsen and believe I am making use of his work here in
accordance with the implicit licensing agreement (or lack thereof) of the source code provided with his book.
